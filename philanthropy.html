 	<p>
     Alpha Omicron Pi was founded on a promise to serve not only one another but the greater community as well. This commitment reflects a philosophy of friendship, concern, and usefulness in the world. The promise to serve can be seen in the relationships within a collegiate or alumnae chapter as they work together to help a sister or as they contribute to the AOII Foundation to enable scholarships and aid to other members. In addition, AOIIs exhibit their commitment to be servant leaders as they participate in a project that raises funds for AOII's philanthropy, arthritis research and the American Juvenile Arthritis Organization.
     Alpha chapter also supports other philanthropic causes by participating in events such as Relay for Life, for which we raised over $3,500. Through involvement in campus activities, our sisters reach out to the entire student body. When sisters are actively involved in campus organizations and activities of their choosing, we learn from each others'special interests and grow from these experiences.
     If you would like to learn more about our philanthropy events or how to get involved with our Walk to Cure Arthritis team, please email philanthropy. aoii.alpha@gmail.com for details.

 			<h3>Strike out Arthritis</h3>
 		To raise money for the Arthritis Foundation, our chapter hosted an event last year, Pandamonium: A Carnival to Strike Out Arthritis, which raised over $1,500. Stay tuned for details about our next Strike Out Arthritis event in Fall 2014. Additionally, sisters have participated in the Jingle Bell Run and the Walk to Cure Arthritis.
